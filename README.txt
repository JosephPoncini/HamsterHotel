// Hamster Hotel

// Hotel Website for Hamsters based off an adobe xd prototype. To help with Responsiveness I made 3 css files for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile Mode(there's a lot of redundant lines so sorry about that)

// Peer Review Comments: This website looks good in desktop but everything is really large, maybe change the size of the site to fit the viewport somehow so you dont have to scroll left and right
for tablet there is a large gap on the right side of the site so maybe there is something pushing it over to the left
For Mobile its sort of the same issue with the desktop is having where its a little too wide for the viewport. Other than that everything is good, its a solid base and with just a few revisions it can be better but I think its solid so far.
